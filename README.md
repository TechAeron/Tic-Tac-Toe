# Tic-Tac-Toe
Source Code for Tic Tac Toe project made by VA Tech.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBc-NP766KE

 This is a simple mini project in C programming. 
1. The game is to be played between two people (player1 and player2). 
2. We've assigned 'X' to the player-1 and 'O' to the player-2.
3. The game starts with player-1 and the game ends when one of the players completes whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective symbol (‘O’ or ‘X’). 
4. If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
